React Learning Journey
About

I’m Estif, a self-taught front-end developer focused on learning React through hands-on projects and deep understanding of fundamentals rather than shortcuts.

What I Learned : 

1, React components & JSX
2, Props and component communication
3, Conditional rendering & list rendering
4, Event handling and controlled inputs
5, Hooks - useState, 
         - useEffect, 
         - useContext, 
         - useRef
